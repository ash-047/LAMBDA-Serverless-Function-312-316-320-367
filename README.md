# LAMBDA-Serverless-Function

## The objective of this project is to design and implement a serverless function execution platform, similar to AWS Lambda, that enables users to deploy and execute functions on-demand via HTTP requests. The system will support multiple programming languages (Python and JavaScript) and enforce execution constraints such as time limits and resource usage restrictions. 
## To optimize execution, the platform will integrate at least two virtualization technologies, such as Firecracker MicroVMs, Nanos Unikernel, or Docker Containers, leveraging techniques like pre-warmed execution environments and request batching for improved performance. 
## A key feature of the system is a web-based monitoring dashboard that provides real-time insights into function execution metrics, including request volume, response times, error rates, and resource utilization. The backend will handle function deployment, execution, and logging, while a frontend interface will allow users to manage and monitor their functions.
